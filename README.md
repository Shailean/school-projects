I attended [Generation USA](https://usa.generation.org/)'s Junior Web Developer bootcamp from May 2022 to September 2022 where I worked on a **[To Do List (Task Manager) app](https://github.com/Shailean/school-projects/tree/main/to-do-list-app)** group project. I was responsible for creating the wireframe, CSS, and an error message (when a required field is left blank) using JavaScript.

I am currently enrolled (as of October 19, 2022) in [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044)'s Full Stack Developer bootcamp (as a scholarship recipient sponsored by Cognizant) with a graduation date of March 2023.

In Udacity's Full Stack Developer bootcamp I completed the following projects so far:
1. **[Animal Trading Card](https://github.com/Shailean/portfolio/tree/main/animal-trading-card)**: using HTML, CSS, and a design prototype I was asked to show understanding of how to utilize classes in HTML in order to apply styling to elements in CSS. This project showcases my ability to utilize proper syntax to create a visually appealing design.
2. **Financial Literacy Game**: using Python, I created a game that explains the mortgage application process that banks use to assess an individual's application for a home loan. 
    - Requirements: 
      - Descriptions are printed to the console for the player to see.
      - The time.sleep function is used to create delays between messages so that they aren't all printed at once.
      - The input function is used to ask the player what they would like to do. The player's choices affect what happens in the game.
      - If the player enters a choice that is not valid, the game gives them the chance to retry until they enter a valid option. The game does not crash and does not treat invalid input as a valid choice.
      - The code includes at least four function definitions that are used to improve the code in some way, such as by: (i) Reducing repetition, (ii) Reducing complexity, (iii) Improving the readability or organization of the code
      - The pycodestyle tool reports zero errors and zero warnings.
      - The program is a playable game, and runs from start to finish without crashing or displaying errors.
