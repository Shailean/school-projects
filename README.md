I attended Generation USA's Junior Web Developer bootcamp from May 2022 to September 2022 where I worked on a **To Do List (Task Manager) app** group project. I was responsible for creating the wireframe, CSS, and an error message (when a required field is left blank) using JavaScript.

I am currently enrolled in Udacity's Full Stack Developer bootcamps where I completed the following projects:
- **Animal Trading Card**: using HTML, CSS, and a design prototype I was asked to show understanding of how to utilize classes in HTML in order to apply styling to elements in CSS. This project showcases my ability to utilize proper syntax to create a visually appealing design.
