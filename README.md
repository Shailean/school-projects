In Udacity's Full Stack Developer bootcamp I completed the following projects:
1. **[Animal Trading Card](https://github.com/Shailean/portfolio/tree/main/school-projects/1-animal-trading-card)**: using HTML, CSS, and a design prototype I was asked to show understanding of how to utilize classes in HTML in order to apply styling to elements in CSS. This project showcases my ability to utilize proper syntax to create a visually appealing design.
2. **[Financial Literacy Game](https://github.com/Shailean/portfolio/tree/main/school-projects/2-financial-lit-mortgages)**: using Python, I created a game that explains the mortgage application process that banks use to assess an individual's application for a home loan. 
3. **[Pixel Art Maker](https://github.com/Shailean/pixel-art-maker)**: write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece.
