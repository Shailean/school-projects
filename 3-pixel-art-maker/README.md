## Project Requirements

Build a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.

Starter code is provided, including HTML and CSS, to build the application. Write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece.

Users should be able to:

1. Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
2. Choose a color.
3. Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.

The primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.
